## Module 9 Sql Data Analysis
## Created an E-R Model
- This maps the relationship between each table we will create from the data provided
- The image is located in the EmployeeSQL folder
## Create tables to read in csv files 
- To input the data into the tables I used the import/export button through pgAdmin
- The csv files are in the data folder & the table schemata is located in the EmployeeSQL folder
## Use queries to filter the data 
- I put all of the queries onto one .sql file and seperated them by commenting
- The queries can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder
